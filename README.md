Customer Churn in Telecom Industry : Basic Exploratory Data Analysis
What is customer churn? As per Wikipedia definition, customer churn, also known as customer attrition, 
customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. Customer churn rate is a
key business metric in any industry and company providing services to end customers, because the cost of
retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

In a highly competitive business landscape, the ever increasing rate of customer churn or attrition is a 
big challenge in front of telecom service providers today. It takes subtantial effort and investment to lure
in new customers, while the danger of losing existing customers to competitors is always lurking. Hence, the 
importance to analyze and understand the reasons of customer's churn had never been felt more. The more the 
CSPs are able to retain their existing customer base, the better they will perform in the long run.
